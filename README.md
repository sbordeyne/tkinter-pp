### KeybindingEntry
A `tk.Entry` which reacts to key presses, so that you can record keybindings in a tkinter-friendly way.

### EntrySelectFolder
A `tk.Entry` which provides a button to select a folder using `tkinter.filedialog.askdirectory`.

The path writes itself inside the entry.

### DialogueEntry

A dialogue box with a `tk.Entry` inside.

### LabelEntry
A label and an entry packaged in one label. You can provide configure options for each of the label
by prefacing the kwarg name with `label_` and `entry_`. You can supply any `Entry` widget, defaulting
to `tk.Entry`.

### PopupMenu

A convenient class to create popup (contextual) menus easily. You can specify a list of callbacks
for the menu to call when it's opened, using the `callbacks` keyword argument.

You can add commands, cascades, or separators just like you would for a menu bar.

### DirTree

A widget that shows the desired directory, in a Treeview.

## Assets included

![Asset_Bitmaps Screenshot](/images/assets.png)

Some xbm bitmaps are available as well, in a string form. Use `tk.BitmapImage(data=..., maskdata=...)`
to create the bitmaps.

The assets are available in the "assets" submodule. Use `import tkinterpp.assets` to import.

You can also generate a bitmap object directly through the `Bitmap` class in this fashion:
```python
from tkinterpp import Bitmap
bitmap = Bitmap()

folder = bitmap.folder()  # folder bitmap object

folder_yellow = bitmap.folder(fg='yellow')  # yellow folder bitmap object
```

## Custom Variables

Custom variables like `DateVar`, used in the `Calendar` widget, are available through the `variables`
submodule. Use `import tkinterpp.variables` to import.

## Create Tooltips

A simple class to add tooltips to any tkinter widget. Simply create an instance of `CreateTooltip`, 
pass in the widget you want the tooltip to appear on, and the text of the tooltip
